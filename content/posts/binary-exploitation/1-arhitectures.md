The instruction set architecture (ISA) defines the set of instructions that a processor can execute and how those instructions are encoded in machine code. It specifies the behavior and functionality of the machine code, including how software communicates with the CPU.


## x86 and x64

With terms x86 and x64 we refer to the two most widely-used instruction set architectures developed by Intel and AMD. They are based on complex instruction set computer (CISC) design philosophy where single instruction can execute several low-level operations. 

- x86 (x86-32 or IA-32): The term x86 originally referred to the 32-bit version of the Intel 8086 processor introduced in 1978. The x86 architecture is a 32-bit architecture and was widely used in personal computers and servers in the past.

- x64 (x86-64 or AMD64): x64 is the 64-bit extension of the x86 architecture. It was introduced by AMD with their AMD64 architecture. Intel later adopted the same architecture with their Intel 64. It has become the dominant architecture in the personal computer and server markets. The architecture is backward compatible as it includes support for executing instructions in the 32-bit x86 instruction set, which means it can execute both 32-bit and 64-bit software.

Both uses the little endian byte order. In little endian, the least significant byte of a multi-byte value is stored at the lowest memory address, while the most significant byte is stored at the highest memory address. For example, if we have a 32-bit value 0x1A2B3C4D, it will be stored in memory as `4D 3C 2B 1A`.


## ARM

Another big player in this world is ARM. It is a type of architecture developed by ARM Holdings. This architecture is based on the reduced instruction set computing (RISC) design philosophy, which aims for simplicity and efficiency in instruction execution. The architecture is widely deployed in mobile and embedded systems. Lately also in personal computers.

- ARM64 (AArch64): is the 64-bit version of the ARM architecture. It is an extension of the 32-bit ARM architecture. It is also backward compatible with 32-bit ARM arcitecture. An example of a processor based on the ARM64 architecture is the Apple Silicon M1 chip.

ARM supports both little endian and big endian byte ordering, and the specific byte order depends on specific implementation. In a case of big endian a 32-bit value 0x1A2B3C4D would be stored in memory as `1A 2B 3C 4D`.
