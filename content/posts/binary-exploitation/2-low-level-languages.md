## Machine code
Machine code is the lowest level of programming language. It represents the binary instructions that are executed directly by a computer's processor. Each instruction in machine code corresponds to a specific operation or data manipulation performed by the processor. These instructions are specific to a particular processor architecture, meaning that **machine code for one type of processor may not be compatible with another type**. Machine code instructions are often represented using hexadecimal notation for human readability. Example of such machine code for x86 architecture is below.
```
b8 04 00 00 00 b9 05 00 00 00 c3
```

## Assembly language

Assembly language is a low-level programming language that uses mnemonic codes to represent machine instructions specific to a particular computer architecture. These mnemonics are more human-readable than binary machine code. It serves as an intermediary between machine code and high-level programming languages.

To execute assembly code, it must first be translated into machine code. This translation process is performed by an assembler, which converts the mnemonic instructions into their corresponding binary representations. The resulting machine code can then be executed directly by the computer's processor.

Overall, assembly language provides a level of abstraction above machine code while still retaining a close relationship to the hardware, allowing for efficient and low-level programming.

Different instruction set architectures have their own unique instruction sets and therefore their own assembly language. For x86 architecture we have x86 Assembly with two commonly used dialects: Intel syntax and AT&T syntax. These syntaxes have some differences in notation and operand ordering. In this blog we will stick with Intel syntax.

Machine code from above can be disassembled into its equivalent x86 Assembly representation in Intel syntax as follows.
```
b8 04 00 00 00      mov    eax,0x4
b9 05 00 00 00      mov    ecx,0x5
c3                  ret
```
